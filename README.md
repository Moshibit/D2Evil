# D2Evil
Managed waifu model parsing libs.

Currently, only binaries will be provided.

If you have interests on file format internals, you can have a look of my old codes at some [fork](https://github.com/NiaBie/FreeLive).

Disclaimer: The code in the "fork" was written by me, but now it's not in my control.

Or, you can contact me via email if you want to participate in development.

### D2Evil.Incubator
